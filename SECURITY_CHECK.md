## Files That WILL Be Pushed (Safe)

```
✅ .gitignore (updated with security rules)
✅ README.md (documentation)
✅ SUMMARY.md (development summary)
✅ .env.example (placeholder file)
✅ app/* (all application code)
✅ lib/* (Firebase config using env vars)
✅ package.json, package-lock.json
✅ tsconfig.json, eslint.config.mjs
✅ next.config.ts, postcss.config.mjs
```

## Files That Will NOT Be Pushed (Protected)

```
❌ .env.local (actual Firebase credentials)
❌ pppl-ede4b-firebase-adminsdk-*.json (Firebase Admin SDK)
❌ .next/ (build folder)
❌ node_modules/ (dependencies)
❌ Any *.pem or *.key files
```

## Firebase Public Keys Note

**IMPORTANT**: Firebase client-side keys (NEXT_PUBLIC_*) are designed to be public and are safe to commit. They are protected by:
- Firestore security rules
- Firebase Auth rules
- Domain restrictions
- API quotas

These keys in `lib/firebase.ts` are SAFE for public repos.

## Ready to Push

✅ Repository is safe to push to GitHub public repo
✅ No sensitive data will be exposed
✅ All security best practices followed

## Next Steps After Push

1. Other developers clone the repo
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
3. Fill in their own Firebase credentials
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm run dev`
